        <p class="text-center"><a href="https://www.s-cubed.com/" target="_blank"><strong>S-Cubed</strong></a> was an amazing experience. Working on the control software for advanced custom-built-to-order lithography equipment, I was able to push code, walk into the next room and see my code executing on the machines immediately. I was exposed to so many technologies and concepts. Every day was an adventure where I got to learn something new.</p>
